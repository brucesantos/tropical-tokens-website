  <p>A digital-crossroad for meaningful content</p>

  <h1>NFTs for content that matters!</h1>

  <blockquote>
    <h2>A manifest of digital-tropicality</h2>

    <p>Digital-tropicality means a virtual odyssey of warmth, rain, and free expression of human potential.</p>

    <p>This is what Tropical Tokens is based on: a solid gateway from the tropical zone to the pinnacle of creation in
      the digital world.</p>


    <p><strong>Our mission:</strong> to make the world of content creation and access more horizontal and viable.
      By bringing people closer to their passions and dreams, as the energy of the tropics
      transpires, our desire is to encourage free expression of content creators, supporters,
      appreciators, fans, as well as of a diverse range of other players, such as NGOs, minority or
      isolated communities, social integration projects and so on, to bring to life and make hugely
      accessible an infinite number of meaningful contents and their power to inspire new
      perspectives.</p>


    <p>Tropical Tokens is the backbone of content development between creators, digitality, and
      supporters of all kinds.</p>


    <p>Art, sports, nature, humanities, and content created in an ever-growing myriad of
      universes… Name it! We have it.</p>


    <p>We have a Brazilian soul and DNA, the country that created and best embodies the concept
      of “tropicality”. We know in our bones what warmth and rain feels like, from a spotless blue
      sky to a torrential tropical storm in a matter of seconds.</p>


    <p>We are sure that hardship and lack of structure may push people to create and express
      themselves with substance and meaning, creating ingenious solutions, and pushing
      boundaries in authentic and unique ways. However, the circulation of these creations isn’t
      usually on a par to their levels of innovation, creativity and impact.</p>


    <p>Digital-tropicality is multiplicity, synergy and abundance. It’s feasibility.</p>


    <p>
      We do not seek to make a profit from other people’s creations or unique personal narratives,
      rather, we seek to invest in non-mainstream content creators and means of expression,
      providing not only the platform but, in some cases, the sponsorship for the provision of said
      unique content.</p>


    <p>Digital-tropicality is the decentralized connection of the cyber-rainforest. Blockchain is the
      mycelial. NFTs are spurs of creation.</p>


    <p>We believe that blockchain technology lights the way to a non-hierarchical means of content
      creation and circulation, giving both creators and appreciators the possibility to connect
      directly through the use of our platform.</p>


    <p>Viral is toxicity. Digital-tropicality is homeostasis.</p>


    <p>Tropical Tokens is content based on meaning, not viral, rather real-life applicability of
      technology. Digital with a pulse, if you will.</p>
